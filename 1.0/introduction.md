## Introduction to Parable

Parable is a no-nonsense PHP micro-framework, meant to be fast, readable and written in a way where it's not bogging 
you down with unnecessary rules and limitations. Developed with the goal of building small web applications and REST APIs.

The following are specific design goals for Parable:
1. Be fast.
1. Be logical.
1. Be easy to read and understand.
1. Be easy to extend.

## Who made this?

Parable is primarily built by [Robin de Graaf](https://github.com/devvoh), under the [devvoh](https://devvoh.com) moniker.

Contributions have from time to time been made by others (i.e. [@jerry1970](https://github.com/jerry1970), 
[@dmvdbrugge](https://github.com/dmvdbrugge) and [@faapz](https://github.com/faapz)).

## Can I help?

Of course! Whether you've got a bug fix or a feature you want to implement, contributions are always welcome!

But before you start fixing something or building your feature, check first whether it fits the following contribution guidelines:

1. All features should be interesting for most developers.
2. All features should be relevant _now_.
3. All features should be written by following the KISS principle.
4. Bloat is bad.
