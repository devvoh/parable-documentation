## Overview

Parable allows you to build your own way. It can help you as little or as much as you want. The following are possibilities specifically considered while developing Parable:

## Full Parable Framework
The full power of Parable, allowing for the use of everything Parable offers, from DI from start to finish, Config, Inits and Parable's MVC structure. If your application expects to grow beyond a handful of routes, this is the way to go.

Check out the chapter on [Parable Framework](../getting-started/parable-framework).

## Framework using simple routing
This method doesn't leverage everything available in Parable, but it can be very useful for smaller applications, like simple REST APIs, small websites or even just for prototyping. 

Check out the chapter on [Simple Routing](../getting-started/simple-routing).

## Just use the components
All components available with the Parable package are usable individually. This can be useful if you want to build [Console](../components/console) applications or just use the [Routing](../components/routing) or [ORM](../components/orm).
